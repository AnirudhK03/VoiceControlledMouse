# VoiceControlledMouse
Utilizing python, we created a voice controlled computer mouse that can accomplish basic tasks such as moving across the screen, clicking, copying, pasting, and entering things into search bar.

# Team
Om Amin, Anirudh Kondapaneni, Darrel Jobin

# Why?
Fun project that we decided to do for our Ohio Hackathon (Hack OH/IO)

# Downfalls/Things to Improve
1.) The way the program took voice input was a little wonky and can be improved.
2.) Has the ability to add much more fetaures such as instantly opening google based on voice command, and searching up phrases instantly instead of
asking to first got to search bar. Quality of life improvements.
